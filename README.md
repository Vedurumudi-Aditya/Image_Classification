# Image Classification
This repository contains a Python script for classifying images as cats or dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with TensorFlow.

## Overview
The script uses a synthetic dataset of images (replace with real dataset for practical use). It builds and trains a CNN to classify images as either cat or dog, then evaluates its performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tensorflow
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- opencv-python

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn opencv-python
```

## Usage
Run the script to train the model and see predictions:
```bash
python image_classification.py
```

## Output
- Test accuracy of the model
- Example prediction for a sample image

## Note
Replace the synthetic dataset with a real dataset (e.g., Kaggle Cats vs Dogs) for practical application.
