Image Classification
This repository contains a Python script for classifying images as cats or dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with TensorFlow.
Overview
The script uses a synthetic dataset of images (replace with real dataset for practical use). It builds and trains a CNN to classify images as either cat or dog, then evaluates its performance.
Requirements

Python 3.x
tensorflow
numpy
scikit-learn
opencv-python

Installation
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn opencv-python

Usage
Run the script to train the model and see predictions:
python image_classification.py

Output

Test accuracy of the model
Example prediction for a sample image

Note
Replace the synthetic dataset with a real dataset (e.g., Kaggle Cats vs Dogs) for practical application.
